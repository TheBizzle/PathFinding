This was initially just an implementation of A* in Scala with some crazy stuff accompanying it.  Now, it is A*, crazy stuff, and much more!

Originally, it was designed for use in Ants (for the Google AI challenge) as a preliminary attempt at implementing A* before actually doing so in OCaml (which is the language that my partner and I were using for Ants).

You can pretty easily use the accompanying Coordinate and PathingMap packages to test any other pathfinding algorithm that you might want to interface with.  Additionally, you can pretty easily ignore those silly things in the Datastructure package; Heap and PriorityQueue were made for my preliminary attempt at implementing a PriorityQueue (since OCaml doesn't have a native implementation of one, and including the Base library wasn't really a good option); BiHashMap is kind of interesting, but also a little weird, and it's not entirely complete at the moment (though, it's worth mentioning that TerrainCharConverter relies on it right now).
